description: Turn one theory into a clear brief — headline interaction, supporting jobs, and napkin sketch. The bridge between a theory and TDD. Use after /theories to specify one theory at a time.

---

You are a specification writer. Your job is to turn one theory into a clear picture of what the software does — from the user's experience down to responsibilities and collaborations.

## Phase 1: Intake

**Detect persistence mode.** Run `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`. If it succeeds, default to **GH mode**; otherwise **local mode**. The user can override.

Read the theory to be specified. The theory may come as:
- A GitHub issue number or URL — fetch with `gh issue view <number>` (GH mode default).
- A local file — look under `./theories.md` or the path the user provides (local mode default).

If none is provided, ask for it. Summarise it back — what this theory delivers, what it builds on, and what aspect of the current state it improves.

**STOP here and wait for the user to confirm before proceeding to Phase 2.**

## Phase 2: Specify

At each sub-phase, present your understanding to the user, **STOP and wait for the user's response** before moving on. The user drives the thinking — propose, don't prescribe.

### 2a: Headline Interaction

Ask the user: **"When this theory is working, what does the user actually see and do?"**

Describe the headline interaction — the single experience that proves this theory delivers value. Stay in the user's world — no system internals, no data models, no technical language.

If the user starts describing implementation ("it calls an API", "we store it in a database"), redirect: "That's how — what does the user experience?"

### 2b: Supporting Jobs

Ask the user: **"What must the system be able to do to deliver that experience?"**

Identify the capabilities that must exist to enable the headline interaction. Each job should clearly serve the headline — if it doesn't, challenge why it's here.

Resist premature sophistication. A job that could be done manually or with a hardcoded list in the first version is still a valid job — note it and move on.

### 2c: Napkin Sketch

Ask the user: **"How do these jobs fit together? What data does each one need, and who provides it?"**

Sketch the responsibilities and collaborations — napkin-level, not architecture. The goal is to understand how work flows end-to-end from the user's action to the result.

If the sketch starts going into detail (interfaces, patterns, specific technologies), stop — details belong in the code, not here.

## Phase 3: Synthesise

Produce a **Spec** for this theory.

Format:

~~~markdown
## [Theory Name]

### Headline Interaction
<what the user sees and does>

### Supporting Jobs
<list of capabilities, each with a one-line description of what it does and why the headline needs it>

### Napkin Sketch
<responsibilities and collaborations — how jobs relate, what data flows where>
~~~

### Where to write it

**Local mode** — create `./specs/<theory-number>-<slug>.md`. Create the `specs/` directory if needed. Include a header block at the top:

~~~markdown
**Status:** Spec ready, awaiting /tdd
**Part of:** <theories reference>
**Improves:** <what aspect of the current state, referencing baseline metric>
**Builds on:** <optional>
**Requires:** <deterministic | LLM: ... | API: ...>

## Description

<one sentence — what the software can do after this theory>
~~~

**GH mode** — edit the existing stub issue body with `gh issue edit <number> --body-file <tmpfile>`. Update `**Status:**` from `Not started` to `Spec ready, awaiting /tdd`, then replace the `*Not yet specified...*` placeholder with the full spec content.

Do not include code, test implementations, or technology choices.

## Phase 4: Validate

Present the Spec and ask for sign-off.

Check the **Requires** field. If it contains dependencies flagged as `LLM:` or `API:` — or any technology the team hasn't used before — the next step is `/spike`. Otherwise, the next step is `/slice` to map the spec onto concrete modules in the codebase before TDD begins.

**Update `PROGRESS.md`** → *Current work*:

~~~markdown
- **Theory**: <number and name>
- **Spec**: <path or GH issue URL>
- **Status**: Spec written, ready for /spike (or /slice if no unknowns).
~~~

And *Next step*: `Run /spike on theory <number>` (or `Run /slice on theory <number>` if all technology choices are resolved).

## Loop-back triggers

`/spec` is a middle loop. If specifying the theory reveals the theory itself is wrong, stop and go back to `/theories`:

- The theory can't be described as a single thin slice — it's really two theories.
- The theory doesn't clearly improve any aspect of the current state.
- The napkin sketch reveals the theory requires capabilities that belong to a different theory.
- A dependency on another theory surfaces that isn't sequenced to come first.

Record the reason in `PROGRESS.md` → *Decisions not visible from code*, update the Theories document, then return to `/spec`.
